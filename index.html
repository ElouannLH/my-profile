				  	<h2>Football</h2>
				  	<p>My greatest passion is and always has been football, which I played for 12 years at the highest level in each category (national). I stopped last year because of injuries and a loss of motivation. I don't play for a club anymore, but I still follow the matches. I try as much as I can to go and see my friends play when I get home. I have so many great memories from all those years.

				  	<h2>Ski</h2>
				  	<p>Living close to the mountains and resorts in Haute Savoie, I've always done a lot of skiing every winter. I did it in a club when I was younger, and now I continue to go as much as I can every winter, especially with my friends. It's such a different feeling from most other sports, in the right conditions, I think it's my favourite thing to do.

				  	<h2>Video Games</h2>
				  	<p>Video games have always been something I've enjoyed, and I discovered them while on holiday at my cousins' house. Then I got my first console, and since then I've continued to play all sorts of games, more or less depending on the period and the time I have. It's something that lets you relax and have a great time with lots of people.

				  	<h2>My Friends</h2>
				  	<p>The last passion I want to share isn't really concrete. It's just the simple fact of going out with friends, without necessarily having a programme, going to the lake for a swim, then going to play football, then why not go bowling, having a good time with your mates without really knowing what you're going to do in advance.
